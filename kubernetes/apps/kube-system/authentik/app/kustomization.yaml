# Combine all Authentik blueprint files from app directories into single ConfigMap
# Each app manages its own blueprint file in its directory (source of truth)
# Copies in this directory are used by Kustomize (symlinks don't work in Flux's temp checkout)
# When an app is removed, its blueprint file is removed, and the copy here should be removed too
# This ensures no orphaned authentication config is left behind
