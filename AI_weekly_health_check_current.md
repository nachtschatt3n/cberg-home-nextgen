## Detailed Findings

### 1. Hardware Health
⚠️ **Status: WARNING** - Hardware errors detected
- Node 192.168.55.12: **19** errors recorded
- Node 192.168.55.11: **1** error recorded
- **Analysis**: Check dmesg on node 12 for specific hardware issues (likely network or disk).

### 2. Prometheus Alerts
⚠️ **Status: WARNING** - Active alerts
- **Alerts**: 3 firing
- **Details**: Longhorn PVC `clawd-bot-data` usage high/critical.
- **Root Cause**: New volume usage reporting or actual fullness.

### 3. UnPoller Status
⚠️ **Status: WARNING** - Metrics configuration change & errors
- Service: **UP**
- Metrics: **Empty** in Prometheus (expected due to InfluxDB switch)
- Logs: 2 errors (401 Unauthorized) - intermittent auth issues with UniFi controller.

### 4. Home Assistant
⚠️ **Status: WARNING** - Integration errors
- Error count: 19 errors in last 100 lines
- **Primary Issue**: `TeslaFi` integration `KeyError: 'None'` in update coordinator.
- **Impact**: Non-critical background task failure.

### 5. Battery Health
✅ **Status: EXCELLENT** - No critical batteries
- **Status**: No devices reported with <30% battery.
- **Verification**: Script execution successful (sh fix confirmed).

## Action Items

### 🟡 High Priority (Address Soon)
1. **Node 12 Hardware Errors**
   - **Issue**: 19 errors reported.
   - **Action**: Investigate logs (`talosctl dmesg --nodes 192.168.55.12`).

2. **UnPoller 401 Errors**
   - **Issue**: Unauthorized errors in logs.
   - **Action**: Check UniFi controller credentials in secret.

### 🔵 Medium Priority (Monitor)
1. **clawd-bot volume usage**
   - **Issue**: Prometheus alerts for high usage.
   - **Action**: Verify actual usage vs requested size.

2. **Home Assistant Tesla Integration**
   - **Issue**: Python traceback in logs.
   - **Action**: Check for integration updates or configuration issues.

## Summary

**Overall Health**: 🟡 **Good**

The cluster is in good health with **zero critical issues**.
- **Fixed**: Pod evictions and health check script execution errors.
- **Monitoring**: Hardware errors on one node and some integration noise (Home Assistant, UnPoller) are the only active concerns.
- **Infrastructure**: Core systems (Storage, Network, Backup) are fully operational.
