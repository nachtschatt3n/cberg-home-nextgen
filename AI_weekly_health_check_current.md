## Current Health Check Report

# Kubernetes Cluster Health Check Report
**Date**: 2026-01-17 19:18 CET
**Cluster**: cberg-home-nextgen
**Nodes**: 3 (k8s-nuc14-01, k8s-nuc14-02, k8s-nuc14-03)
**Duration**: N/A

## Executive Summary
- **Overall Health**: 🟠 **Warning**
- **Critical Issues**: **1** (Pod evictions detected - resolved by limit increase)
- **Warnings**: 4 (UnPoller metrics missing, UnPoller errors, Home Assistant integration errors, High warning event count)
- **Service Availability**: 99% (most services healthy, UnPoller metrics unavailable in Prometheus)
- **Uptime**: All systems operational
- **Node Status**: ✅ **ALL 3 NODES HEALTHY**
- **Recent Changes**: UnPoller service created, clawd-bot volume limit increased, git-test pod removed

## Service Availability Matrix
| Service | Internal | External | Health | Response | Status Notes |
|---------|----------|----------|--------|----------|--------------|
| Authentik | ✅ | ✅ | Healthy | N/A | Authentication operational (6/6 pods ready) |
| Home Assistant | ✅ | ✅ | Warning | N/A | 30 errors/100 lines - external integrations failing |
| Nextcloud | ✅ | ✅ | Healthy | N/A | Operational |
| Jellyfin | ✅ | ✅ | Healthy | N/A | Running normally |
| Grafana | ✅ | ✅ | Healthy | N/A | Monitoring dashboards working |
| Prometheus | ✅ | ✅ | Healthy | N/A | 0 firing alerts |
| Alertmanager | ✅ | ✅ | Healthy | N/A | Operational |
| Longhorn UI | ✅ | ✅ | Healthy | N/A | Storage management accessible |
| UnPoller | ✅ | N/A | Warning | N/A | Service created, target UP, but metrics empty (User switched to InfluxDB) |
| Backup System | ✅ | N/A | Excellent | N/A | Last backup successful |

## Detailed Findings

### 1. UnPoller Status
⚠️ **Status: WARNING** - Metrics configuration change
- Service created: `unpoller` (ClusterIP, port 9130)
- Prometheus Target: **UP** (10.69.1.36:9130)
- Metrics: **Empty** in Prometheus
- **Root Cause**: User switched UnPoller to InfluxDB backend. Prometheus scraping is enabled but returning no device metrics.
- **Action**: Acknowledged configuration change.

### 2. Pod Evictions
🔴 **Status: CRITICAL (Resolved)** - Evictions detected
- Affected Pods: `clawd-bot`
- Reason: `npm-cache` volume limit exceeded (500Mi)
- **Resolution**: Volume limit increased to 2Gi in HelmRelease.
- Current Status: Eviction events visible in history, but new pods running correctly.

### 3. Home Assistant
⚠️ **Status: WARNING** - Integration errors
- Error count: 30 errors in last 100 lines
- Affected Integrations: Bermuda (BLE), Deebot, Shelly
- **Analysis**: External connectivity or device issues causing log noise. Core functionality appears intact.

### 4. GitOps Status
✅ **Status: EXCELLENT** - Fully Synchronized
- Git sources: All reconciled
- Kustomizations: All reconciled
- HelmReleases: All Ready

## Action Items

### 🟡 High Priority (Address Soon)
1. **UnPoller Metrics**
   - **Issue**: Health check expects Prometheus metrics, but UnPoller uses InfluxDB.
   - **Action**: Update health check script to skip Prometheus checks for UnPoller or query InfluxDB if possible.

2. **Home Assistant Integrations**
   - **Issue**: High error rate from external integrations.
   - **Action**: Investigate specific device connectivity (Shelly, Deebot).

### 🔵 Medium Priority (Monitor)
1. **clawd-bot resource usage**
   - **Issue**: `npm-cache` usage growing.
   - **Action**: Monitor usage against new 2Gi limit.

## Summary

**Overall Health**: 🟠 **Warning**

The cluster is stable with key services operational. The "Warning" status is primarily due to:
1.  **UnPoller configuration change**: Switched to InfluxDB, causing Prometheus-based checks to fail (expected).
2.  **Pod evictions**: Historical events from `clawd-bot` (resolved).
3.  **Home Assistant noise**: Integration errors in logs.

All critical infrastructure (Storage, Network, Backup, Nodes) is in **Excellent** condition.
