| Date | Health Status | Critical Issues | Actions Taken | Notes |
|------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|-------|
| 2026-02-24 (evening) | Excellent | 0 | 0 | **Overall**: ✅ **EXCELLENT** (0 real issues, 2 script false positives). **Script flags**: 1) 3 FATAL errors in Elasticsearch — all from `external-dns` `level=fatal` log field (transient EOF at 01:21/01:31/03:52 UTC, self-recovered, currently stable); 2) 1 failed job — `kube-system/descheduler` was still running at check time (false positive). **Cert alert**: `KubeClientCertificateExpiration WARNING` on `192.168.55.11:6443` was active at session start but self-resolved within minutes — transient rate-based histogram spike from short-lived auth tokens, all actual certs healthy (kubelet: 314d, apiserver p1: 181d, cert-manager: 39–50d). **Cluster**: All 3 nodes healthy, 0 active Alertmanager alerts, 75/75 PVCs Bound, all kustomizations reconciled, backup completed 03:20 UTC. No actions required. |
| 2026-02-22 (evening) | Warning | 1 | 1 | **Overall**: 🟠 **WARNING** (1 real Critical - Elasticsearch FATAL logs, 1 Major - Failed Jobs, 2 Minor). **Actions Taken**: 1) Fixed `nextcloud-cron` failure by adding `securityContext` (UID 33) to the `worker` sidecar in Nextcloud HelmRelease ✅. **Health Check**: Nodes healthy, storage healthy, GitOps synchronized. **Critical/Major Issues**: 1) 6 FATAL/OOM errors in Elasticsearch logs (linked to `external-dns` transient EOF errors - self-recovered); 2) 2 failed `nextcloud-cron` jobs (UID mismatch - resolved). **Minor Issues**: 1) "Hardware errors" on node 12 (identified as opencode OOMs and benign Longhorn iSCSI noise). **Status**: Cluster stable, issues addressed or identified as transient/benign. |
| 2026-02-22 (afternoon) | Good | 0 | 2 | **Overall**: 🟡 **GOOD** (0 Critical, 0 Major, 4 Minor). **Actions Taken**: 1) Deleted stuck job `kube-system/descheduler-29528880` (8h running); 2) Fixed `absenty` Flux Kustomization failures by downgrading `ImagePolicy` manifests to `v1beta2` (API `v1` not supported); 3) Verified "hardware errors" on node 12 are transient DNS timeouts from Feb 19th (false positive). **Health Check**: Nodes healthy, storage healthy, monitoring operational. **Minor Issues**: 1) Talos version drift; 2) 1 Zigbee device offline; 3) music_assistant duplicates; 4) Soil Sensor battery monitoring. **Status**: Cluster healthy, minor issues resolved. |
| 2026-02-22 | Good | 0 | 8 | **Overall**: 🟡 **GOOD** — Major upgrade + maintenance session. **Patch updates**: authentik 2025.12.3→4, vaultwarden 1.35.2→3, adguard-home v0.107.71→72, node-red 4.1.4→5. **Minor updates**: descheduler chart 0.34.0→0.35.0, intel-device-plugin charts 0.34.1→0.35.0 (×2), unpoller v2.33.0→v2.34.0, penpot chart 0.33.0→0.35.0 — all services confirmed running post-upgrade. **open-webui 10.2.1→12.3.0**: Required deleting immutable `open-webui-pipelines` Deployment (chart 12.x changed label selectors), adding `upgrade.timeout: 15m`, explicit Redis URL `redis://open-webui-redis:6379/0`. All pods running post-upgrade. **Flux CRD API migration**: 47 files migrated from deprecated `helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1/v2beta2` → `/v2` and `source/image.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2` → `/v1` (stable). **Renovate ignoreDeps**: Added `nachtschatt3n/k8s-self-ai-ops` (private GitHub repo, no token access). **ECK operator 2.14.0→3.3.0**: No breaking changes for ES/Kibana 8.15.3 users. Upgrade succeeded immediately. **fluent-bit chunk retry backlog**: Diagnosed pre-existing issue — 3600+ queued retry tasks, only 2 workers, 15-retry limit. ES healthy (0 write rejections, 30% heap, logs still ingesting). Fixed by restarting DaemonSet to clear backlog. Added log pipeline monitoring to health check docs. **Deferred (require investigation)**: longhorn 1.10.1→1.11.0 (pre-upgrade volume checks needed), cilium (HA mDNS/UPnP post-validation needed), nextcloud chart 6.6.10→8.9.1, uptime-kuma 2.25.0→4.0.0, Talos/K8s cluster upgrade, n8n v2 migration (BLOCKED), mariadb chart migration (BLOCKED). |

## Current Health Check Report

# Kubernetes Cluster Health Check Report
**Date**: 2026-02-24 (evening) CET
**Cluster**: cberg-home-nextgen
**Nodes**: 3 (k8s-nuc14-01, k8s-nuc14-02, k8s-nuc14-03)
**Kubernetes Version**: v1.34.0

## Executive Summary

- **Critical Issues**: 0
- **Major Issues**: 0
- **Minor Issues**: 0
- **Service Availability**: 100%
- **Node Status**: ✅ ALL 3 NODES HEALTHY

| Elasticsearch | ✅ | N/A | Healthy | Running |
| external-dns | ✅ | ✅ | Healthy | Running, logs stable ("All records up to date") |

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Script "Critical": Elasticsearch FATAL logs — FALSE POSITIVE
✅ **Status: NO ACTION REQUIRED**
- **Script detected**: 3 FATAL entries in Elasticsearch (matched word "fatal")
- **Actual cause**: `external-dns` uses `level=fatal` in its structured log format for transient errors
- **Errors**: `level=fatal msg="Failed to do run once: error reading response body: unexpected EOF"` at 01:21, 01:31, and 03:52 UTC
- **Current state**: Pod running normally, logging "All records are already up to date" every ~60s
- **Note**: external-dns has 47 restarts over 9 days — pattern of transient Cloudflare EOF errors that self-heal; worth monitoring long-term

### 2. Script "Minor": Failed jobs count — FALSE POSITIVE
✅ **Status: NO ACTION REQUIRED**
- **Script detected**: 1 failed job
- **Actual cause**: `kube-system/descheduler` job was still in Running state at time of check; not actually failed
- **Backup jobs**: All complete — `daily-backup-all-volumes` succeeded at 03:20 UTC ✅

### 3. KubeClientCertificateExpiration alert — TRANSIENT, SELF-RESOLVED
✅ **Status: NO ACTION REQUIRED**
- Alert was active on `192.168.55.11:6443` (k8s-nuc14-01) at session start, resolved within minutes
- Root cause: rate-based histogram quantile skewed by burst of short-lived auth token observations
- Actual cert health: kubelet client certs 314 days, apiserver client certs 181 days, cert-manager certs 39–50 days
- All 8 cert-manager certificates Ready ✅

## Infrastructure Metrics
- **Nodes**: 3/3 healthy (Talos v1.11.0, K8s v1.34.0)
- **Pods**: 0 CrashLoopBackOff, 0 Pending, 0 Terminating
- **DaemonSets**: 10/10 healthy (desired=current=ready)
- **PVCs**: 75/75 Bound
- **Kustomizations**: All reconciled (refs/heads/main@sha1:66890ae2)
- **HelmRepositories**: 0 failed
- **Active Alertmanager alerts**: 0

## Action Items
None. Cluster is fully healthy.

## Recurring Pattern to Monitor
- **external-dns EOF restarts** (47 over 9 days): Transient Cloudflare API connection resets. Self-healing, no impact on DNS records. If restart count accelerates, investigate Cloudflare API rate limits or network stability on the k8s-network VLAN.
