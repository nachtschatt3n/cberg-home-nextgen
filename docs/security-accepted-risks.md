## AR-001 — Plaintext Secrets in Public Git History

**Severity at time of discovery:** Critical
**Status:** Accepted — all secrets rotated or services decommissioned

Five secrets were committed in plaintext to the public repository history between 2025-06 and 2025-11. All have been remediated:

| Commit | Service | Secret | Remediation |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| `883de1d2` | Langfuse MinIO | `minioadmin`/`minioadmin` (default) | Rotated 2026-03-20 |
| `1f9319c0` | Kopia backup | Encryption + server password | Service decommissioned |
| `bb2bf972` | pgAdmin | Admin + master password | Rotated 2026-03-19, pod restarted 2026-03-20 |
| `6b335828` | Rybbit | `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` JWT key | Service decommissioned |
| `4aa30e55` | Bytebot | PostgreSQL password + DB URL | Service decommissioned |

History cannot be rewritten on a public repo with potential clones. Rotation is the remediation. Risk accepted.

**Root cause:** Files named `.sops.tmp.yaml` committed before encryption ran. Mitigated by `.gitignore` rule covering `*.sops.tmp.yaml`.

## AR-002 — Mosquitto MQTT `allow_anonymous true`

**Severity at time of discovery:** Warning
**Status:** Accepted — IoT network, internal only

Mosquitto is configured with `allow_anonymous true` alongside a `password_file`. This means the password file is not enforced and any client can connect without credentials.

**Why accepted:** Mosquitto is only accessible within the IoT VLAN (192.168.32.0/23) and the Kubernetes cluster network (192.168.55.0/24). No external exposure. All IoT devices are on a segmented VLAN with restricted inter-VLAN routing. Anonymous MQTT is standard practice in private IoT deployments.

## AR-003 — echo-server on External Ingress Without Auth

**Severity at time of discovery:** Warning
**Status:** Accepted — debug tool, intentional exposure

`default/echo-server` is exposed on the external ingress class without Authentik forward auth. It reflects all HTTP request headers to the caller.

**Why accepted:** This is an intentional debug/testing endpoint. No sensitive data is stored or processed. Header reflection is the design purpose. Accepted as a low-risk operational tool.

## AR-004 — External Apps Without Authentik Forward Auth

**Severity at time of discovery:** Warning
**Status:** Accepted — each app has its own authentication layer

The following apps are on the external ingress class without Authentik forward auth:

| App | Namespace | Own Auth |
|-----|-----------|----------|
| open-webui | ai | Built-in user auth with admin-controlled access |
| n8n | home-automation | Built-in user auth + 2FA support |
| iobroker | home-automation | Built-in user auth |
| home-assistant | home-automation | Built-in user auth with MFA support |

**Why accepted:** All four applications have robust application-level authentication. Adding Authentik forward auth on top would create double-auth friction for legitimate users with no meaningful security gain, as all apps require login before any functionality is accessible.
